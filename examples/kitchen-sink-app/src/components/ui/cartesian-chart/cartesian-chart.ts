/**
 * Resamples a polyline into a dense run of points that trace a smooth

 * primitive both the line and the area series build on so that "smooth" behaves
 * identically for either.
 *
 * ## Why monotone cubic (Fritsch–Carlson), not Catmull-Rom
 * A monotone cubic never overshoots its data: between two points the curve stays
 * inside their y-range, so a smoothed line never bulges past a peak and a
 * smoothed area fill never pokes above the plot or dips below its baseline. That
 * matters here because the axis domain is derived from the *raw* data extremes —
 * an overshooting curve (which Catmull-Rom produces) would render outside the
 * plot and clip. This is the same curve D3 draws for `curveMonotoneX` and the
 * default Recharts `type="monotone"`.
 *
 * ## Why resample instead of emitting a path
 * Lynx has no SVG path: a line is drawn as many short rotated `<view>` segments
 * and an area as sampled column heights. So rather than describe the curve, we
 * return closely-spaced points *on* it, and each caller rasterizes them with the
 * exact same code it already uses for raw data (`computeLineSegments` /
 * `computeAreaColumns`). "Smooth" then costs nothing but a denser point set.
 *
 * Points must be sorted ascending by x (as cartesian data always is). Fewer than
 * three points can't define a curve — two already draw a single straight
 * segment — so they're returned unchanged. `samplesPerSegment` is how many
 * straight chords approximate each original segment; higher is smoother but emits
 * proportionally more native views.

 * ## Why explicit pixel `width`/`height`
 * A line is drawn as rotated `<view>` segments (Lynx has no SVG/`<line>`), and
 * the rotation angle/length can only be computed from *pixel* coordinates. So
 * the chart is sized in explicit px rather than stretching responsively.
 *
 * ## Why absolute positioning works here
 * Lynx has no `position: static` — every element is `position: relative` and an
 * absolute child resolves against its **direct parent**, not a distant
 * ancestor. So the plot area is a definite-size box and every mark must be a
 * direct child of it (or of a series host sized to fill it — see UiLineSeries).

  //   explicitly sets `z-index` (unlike the web, where `z-index: auto` is a
  //   real value); without one, absolutely-positioned children can visually
  //   escape their ancestor's `overflow: hidden` (the same reason
  //   `<x-scroll-view>` needs `z-index: 0` to stop children escaping during
  //   scroll — see investigations/lynx-vs-web-differences.md).
  // - `[flatten]="false"` (template) — Android may "flatten" a view with no
  //   event listeners straight into its parent's canvas instead of giving it
  //   its own native View, which can make its `overflow: hidden` apply
  //   inconsistently (observed: the clip boundary appeared to move with zoom
  //   level, and the bottom edge didn't clip at all). Forcing a dedicated
