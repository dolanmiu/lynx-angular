 * True if attaching `candidate` under `parent` would form a cycle — i.e.
 * `candidate` is `parent` itself or an ancestor of `parent` in the native tree.
 *
 * Lynx's element APIs do NOT guard against this. `FiberElement::InsertNode`
 * auto-reparents a node that still has a parent, but never checks whether the
 * new parent lives inside the node's own subtree, so it will happily build a
 * self-referential tree. The native layout pass would then walk child→child
 * forever, hanging the main thread until the OS watchdog SIGKILLs the app.
 *
 * Kept purely as defensive coding: a same-tick Angular reorder or re-projection
 * can ask to re-insert an element underneath one of its own former descendants
 * (e.g. two siblings swap and one lands inside the other), and appendChild/
 * insertBefore skip that attach rather than corrupt the tree. NOTE: the
 * `LynxTransition` panel freeze that first surfaced this guard was NOT actually a
 * cycle — it was the old child-"parking" mechanism livelocking layout, and that
 * mechanism has since been removed entirely (see #doRemove). The guard stays
 * because the cyclic-attach hazard is genuinely possible and the check is cheap.
 *
 * This is the same ancestor check a browser performs in `insertBefore` (it
 * throws HierarchyRequestError); we return the answer so callers can skip the
 * attach instead of throwing. The walk is bounded by the depth of `parent`, and
 * each step is two cheap native reads — comparable to the tree bookkeeping the
 * attach itself does.
 *
 * Compares by unique ID rather than ref identity: native refs must not be used
