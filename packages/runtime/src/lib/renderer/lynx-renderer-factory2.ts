   * On the main thread, the order is critical:
   *   1. processPendingRemovals() — commits genuine element removals queued
   *      during this cycle. MUST run before the flush so the __RemoveElement
   *      calls land in the SAME flush as the cycle's other mutations; draining
   *      them later (the old queueMicrotask) left removed subtrees occupying
   *      native layout until a later cycle happened to flush ("hidden element
   *      leaves a gap").
   *   2. __FlushElementTree() — commits all pending element mutations to native
   *   3. processPendingListUpdates() — sends update-list-info for lists that
   *      gained/lost children during this CD cycle, then does a targeted flush
   *      per list. This MUST run after the bare flush so list children's subtrees
   *      are already committed when componentAtIndex appends them.
   * Reversing this order causes list items to appear empty (subtree not committed)
   * or crashes from re-entrant __FlushElementTree.
   *
   * Step 1 is skipped entirely while isFirstRenderPending() — see that
   * function's doc comment. Every CD cycle that runs as part of the initial
   * bootstrap is still nested inside the native engine's own renderPage call;
   * we avoid driving a layout-triggering flush (which, for pages with a
   * <list>, re-entrantly calls back into componentAtIndex) from inside a call
   * frame native hasn't finished unwinding. Native performs its own implicit
   * flush once renderPage returns, so skipping this is safe — element
   * creation/attribute calls above already mutate native elements directly,
   * independent of flushing.
